# Design Patterns using C++

Design patterns in programming are general, reusable solutions to common problems that arise during software development. They are not specific code implementations but rather templates or blueprints for solving particular design challenges in a consistent and efficient manner. Design patterns help developers communicate, understand, and apply tried-and-tested solutions, improving code structure and maintainability.

There are three main categories of design patterns:

1. **Creational Patterns**: Focus on object creation mechanisms, making system design more flexible in terms of how objects are created. Examples include:
   - **Singleton**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
   - **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
   - **Builder**: Separates the construction of complex objects from their representation.

2. **Structural Patterns**: Deal with object composition, ensuring that the structure of relationships between objects is simple and flexible. Examples include:
   - **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by acting as a bridge between them.
   - **Decorator**: Adds new behavior to objects dynamically, without altering their structure.
   - **Composite**: Treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Focus on communication and responsibility between objects. They help manage complex control flows in a system. Examples include:
   - **Observer**: Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, its dependents are notified.
   - **Strategy**: Allows selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime by defining a family of algorithms and making them interchangeable.
   - **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing parameterization of clients with different requests, and support for undoable operations.

Design patterns are valuable for creating scalable, maintainable, and robust systems, and they are language-agnostic, making them applicable across various programming languages.
